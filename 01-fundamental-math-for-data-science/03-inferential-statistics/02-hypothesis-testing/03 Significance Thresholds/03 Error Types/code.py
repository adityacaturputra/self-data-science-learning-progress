# Set the correct value for outcome
outcome = 'type two'

# Note that the true average score for students who take the test in an ergonomic chair is 52 points. The null hypothesis for our test is that the average score is 50 points. Therefore, the researcher is running a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is false. A p-value of 0.07 is greater than the significance threshold, and would lead the researcher to conclude (incorrectly) that the average score for students in an ergonomic chair is not significantly different from 50 points.
