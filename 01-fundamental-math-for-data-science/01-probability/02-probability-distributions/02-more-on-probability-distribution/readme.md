# finished second lesson on probability distributions! Let’s review some of the things we’ve learned:

The Poisson distribution and its parameter lambda (λ)
How the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution changes with different values of lambda (λ)
Calculating probabilities of specific values and ranges of values from the Poisson distribution
Calculating probabilities of ranges using the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution
Generating random values from a distribution
Principles of expectation and variance of various distributions
Universal properties of expectation and variance
