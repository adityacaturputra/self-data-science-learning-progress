# The Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that represents the number of times an event occurs in a fixed time and/or space interval and is defined by parameter Î» (lambda).

Examples of events that can be described by the Poisson distribution include the number of bikes crossing an intersection in a specific hour and the number of meteors seen in a minute of a meteor shower.
