## Checkpoint 1
# A certain basketball player has an 85% chance of making a given free throw and takes 20 free throws.
expected_baskets = 20 * 85/100
print(expected_baskets)


## Checkpoint 2
# Let’s say a student has a 98% chance of arriving early or on time to class. Uncomment the variable called expected_late and set it equal to the expected number of times the student will arrive late to class throughout the 180 school days in a school year.
expected_late = 2/100 * 180
print(expected_late)
