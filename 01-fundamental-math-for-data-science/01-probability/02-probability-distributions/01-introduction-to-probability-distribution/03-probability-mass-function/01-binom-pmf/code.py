# Calculating Probabilities using Python
import scipy.stats as stats
# x: the value of interest
# n: the number of trials
# p: the probability of success

# value of interest
# change this
x = 3

# sample size
# change this
n = 10

# calculate probability
prob_1 = stats.binom.pmf(x, n, 0.5)
print(prob_1)

## Question 2
prob_2 = stats.binom.pmf(7, 20, 0.5)
print(prob_2)
