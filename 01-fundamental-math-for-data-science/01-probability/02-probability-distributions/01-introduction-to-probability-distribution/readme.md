# finished our introduction to probability distributions! To review, we have:

Learned about different types of random variables
Calculated the probability of specific events using probability mass functions (discrete random variable)
Calculated the probability of ranges using probability mass functions and cumulative distribution functions (discrete random variable)
Calculated the probability of ranges using probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions (continuous random variable)
